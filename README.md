An API back end for storing images of animals in a database with unique ID's, name of the animal, description of the image, an image name, a list of tags associated with the content of the image, and a category of animal.

Testing pushing to remote and my own repo.

Instructions given:

    1. Create a new Node.js project (npm init).
    2. Install necessary dependencies express (api routing), multer (file uploads), prisma (database ORM), and dotenv (environment variables).
    3. “Scaffold” the project as you have learned in class.
    4. Setup Express and add routes to handle the API’s CRUD requirements. Ensure you are using the correct HTTP methods (verbs) for handing the requests.
    5. Setup Multer to save uploaded files into a “./public/images” folder. Ensure the “public” folder is publicly accessible.
    6. Setup Prisma to use an SQLite database in your project.
